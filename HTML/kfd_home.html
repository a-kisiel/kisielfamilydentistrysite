			<p class="covid">
				As our patients know, we have continued to keep up to date with current NYS Health Department and CDC guidelines to provide a safe dental environment.

				Dr. Kisiel and his staff are adept at performing all standard dental procedures, including crowns, bridges, partial and full dentures, implants, 
				implant-retained crowns and dentures, root canals, extractions, tooth-colored restorations, and more. We won't try to make you pay for anything you don't 
				need, nor will we perform anything we aren't comfortable with -- if we don't think we can do something we have no problems referring you to a 
				trusted nearby specialist who can.

			<h1 id="of-h1" class="tab-header">Online Forms</h1>
			<p> 
				In an effort to save everyone time at the office, we've made some forms available online. Simply print what you need and fill it out
				whenever.
			</p>
			<p style="padding-bottom: 2em;"> 
				If at any point in the process you find that you're
				having some difficulty, feel free to give us a call, stop
				in at the office, or send us an email at <a href="mailto: kisieldent@gmail.com">kisieldent@gmail.com</a>.
			</p>

				<button class="accordion" onclick="activateAcc('acc1')">Form Information</button>
					<div class="acc-panel" id="acc1">
						<p style="padding-top:1em;">
							Currently, this site only provides the PDF versions of forms, and as a result will never ask for any personal 
							 information; be careful handing such information out online.<br/><br/>New patients should download, print, 
							 and fill out the <strong><a href="../Forms/New Patient Packet.pdf" target="_blank" title="New Patient Form" style="color: black; text-decoration: none;">New Patient Questionnaire</a></strong>, then bring it in to the office so we can enter 
							 their information in our books.<br/><br/>
						</p>
					</div>

				<button class="accordion" onclick="activateAcc('acc2')">Troubleshooting/FAQ</button>
					<div class="acc-panel" id="acc2">
						<p style="padding-top: 1em;">The download process for these forms may vary slightly depending on your internet browser, but the differences are minor (and the 
							process itself is fairly easy).<br/><br/> Upon clicking the respective form link below, a new tab containing the form PDF should open.
							 Look for the printer icon in the PDF reader window and it should lead you through the process of printing. If you'd prefer to save 
							 the document, look for the 'download' button instead.<br/><br/>
						</p>
						<p style="font-weight: bold;">I don't see the form I need below -- what should I do?<br/><br/></p>
						<p>
							If you require a specific form that isn't listed below, either send us an email at kisieldent@gmail.com or stop by the 
							office and we'll give you a paper copy.<br/><br/>
						</p>
						<p style="font-weight: bold;">There was a problem with my download/I'm having some other technical difficulties.<br/><br/></p>
						<p>
							First, check where your browser displays your downloaded content (for Google Chrome a box pops up in the bottom left corner, 
							for Firefox the download shows up in the top right). If it's not there try downloading again (sometimes the button doesn't register 
							the first click). If that doesn't work, send us an email and we can send you a direct PDF for the form.<br/><br/>
							If all else fails, you can always come to the office in person and pick up a paper copy.<br/><br/>

			<h2 class="update-date">3/20/2021</h2>
			<p>
				As our patients know, we have continued to keep up to date with current NYS Health Department and CDC guidelines to provide a safe dental environment. We appreciate the overwhelming cooperation we've received from patients during this epidemic. We understand the questions that we have to ask and precautions have tested many people's patience, but they're important to follow in order to keep us all safe.

			<h2 class="update-date">6/10/2020</h2>
			<p>
				Dear Patients,<br/><br/>
				Our community has been through a lot over the last few months, and all of us are looking forward to resuming 
				our normal habits and routines.  While many things have changed, one thing has remained the same: our commitment 
				to your safety.<br/><br/>Infection control has always been a top priority for our practice, and you'll soon see some 
				 changes meant to enhance our already stringent measures in that area. We'd like to tell you about some of the 
				procedures we follow in our practice to keep patients and staff safe.<br/><br/>
				Our office follows infection control recommendations made by the American Dental Association (ADA), the U.S. Centers 
				for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and OSHA.  We follow the activities of these agencies so that we are up-to-date 
				on any new rulings or guidance that may be issued.  We do this to make sure that our infection control procedures are 
				current and adhere to each agency’s recommendations.<br/><br/>
				In the interest of protecting our patients and staff, we ask that you note the following changes in procedure:<br/><br/>
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li><p>
					Our office will communicate with you before your appointment to ask some screening questions. Upon arriving at the 
					office, you'll be asked these questions again and your temperature will be taken.
				</p></li>
				<li><p>
					We will have hand sanitizer as you enter the building and throughout the reception area. Hand washing can be done in the 
					bathroom and treatment rooms as well.
				</p></li>
				<li><p>
					We will not have magazines, children’s toys and other such materials available in the waiting area 
					since these items are difficult to disinfect.
				</p></li>
			</ul>

            <p>
				<br/>Appointments will be managed to allow for social distancing between patients.  That might mean that you’re offered 
				fewer options for scheduling your appointment.  We will do our best to space out our scheduled appointments to reduce 
				both the number of patients in the waiting room and each patient's waiting time.<br/><br/>
				We are happy to answer any questions you may have about the steps we have taken to keep you, and every patient, 
				safe and comfortable in our practice.<br/><br/>
				Sincerely,<br/><br/>
				R.Jeffrey Kisiel and Staff

		<div id="FAQ" class="tab-content">
			<h1 id="faq-h1" class="tab-header">Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

			<p class="question">What is your billing policy?</p>
			<p>
				We don't participate with any particular insurance plans, but rather have one fee for all patients. However, if you have insurance we will 
				gladly process their claim for any dental work. Generally, we prefer cash, check, Mastercard, or Visa as methods of payment at time of service. 
				We also offer payment plans to our regular, trusted patients.
			</p>
			<p class="question">What's the difference between a cap and a crown?</p>
			<p>Nothing -- they mean the same thing.<br/><br/> A crown is recommended when more than half of the tooth structure is either gone or filled. Other reasons for getting a crown include 
				having a root canal or symptoms of Cracked Tooth Syndrome (i.e. cold sensitivity and sharp pain upon biting down).
			</p>
			<p class="question">Is bleaching safe?</p>
			<p>Yes ... if done as recommended.<br/><br/> Bleaching can burn tissue if not applied <em>exclusively</em> to the enamel.
			</p>
			<p class="question">Why do I need x-rays?</p>
			<p>Sometimes we can't detect problems within the teeth/bones themselves just by looking at their outsides -- x-rays provide us with that extra internal perspective.
				Children and the elderly actually develop decay and problems more readily due to changes in diet, hormones, and saliva chemistry. X-rays also allow us 
				to assess the soundness of existing restorations.
			</p>
			<p class="question">Will the shots hurt?</p>
			<p>
				We're told consistently that we give a 'gentle' shot; we also use a topical anesthesia before the injection to minimize the pain.

                    <p> 
                        Dr. Raymond "Jeff" Kisiel grew up in Clinton, NY, a small town near Utica. He graduated from Clinton High School in 1982,
                        Hamilton College in 1986, and SUNY of Buffalo Dental School in 1990. He then extended his education with a dental residency 
                        at Buffalo General Hospital in 1991.<br/><br/>
                        In March 1991, Dr. Kisiel became an associate with Dr. Harvey Dearstyne, eventually buying his practice in January 1993. 
                        He practiced on Pearl Street in Glens Falls until March 2003, when he moved to his current office in Queensbury.

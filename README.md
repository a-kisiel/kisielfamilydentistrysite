# Kisiel Family Dentistry Website

Due to the COVID-19 epidemic, my Dad's practice needed a way to effectively communicate information to his patients. Seeing this as an opportunity to learn more 
about how websites function practically, I wrote everything from the bottom up using various online reference resources (and consulting him/his staff as far as what 
information he wanted to convey, general aesthetics, etc.). I've continued to maintain/update the site as needed.

The site is located at kisielfamilydentistry.com
